### ü§ñ Your First Agent

An **Agent** is the fundamental building block of a swarm‚Äîan autonomous entity powered by a large language model (LLM).

```python
from swarms import Agent

# Initialize a new agent
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini", # Specify the LLM
    max_loops=1,              # Set the number of interactions
    interactive=True,         # Enable interactive mode for real-time feedback
)

# Run the agent with a task
agent.run("What are the key benefits of using a multi-agent system?")
```

### ü§ù Your First Swarm: Multi-Agent Collaboration

A **Swarm** consists of multiple agents working together. This simple example creates a two-agent workflow for researching and writing a blog post.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)

```

## üèóÔ∏è Swarm Architectures for Production Workflows

`swarms` provides a variety of powerful, pre-built architectures to orchestrate agents in different ways. Choose the right structure for your specific problem to build efficient and reliable production systems.

| **Architecture** | **Description** | **Best For** |
|---|---|---|
| **SequentialWorkflow** | Agents execute tasks in a linear chain; one agent's output is the next one's input. | Step-by-step processes like data transformation pipelines, report generation. |
| **ConcurrentWorkflow** | Agents run tasks simultaneously for maximum efficiency. | High-throughput tasks like batch processing, parallel data analysis. |
| **AgentRearrange** | Dynamically maps complex relationships (e.g., `a -> b, c`) between agents. | Flexible and adaptive workflows, task distribution, dynamic routing. |
| **GraphWorkflow** | Orchestrates agents as nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). | Complex projects with intricate dependencies, like software builds. |
| **MixtureOfAgents (MoA)** | Utilizes multiple expert agents in parallel and synthesizes their outputs. | Complex problem-solving, achieving state-of-the-art performance through collaboration. |
| **GroupChat** | Agents collaborate and make decisions through a conversational interface. | Real-time collaborative decision-making, negotiations, brainstorming. |
| **ForestSwarm** | Dynamically selects the most suitable agent or tree of agents for a given task. | Task routing, optimizing for expertise, complex decision-making trees. |
| **SpreadSheetSwarm**| Manages thousands of agents concurrently, tracking tasks and outputs in a structured format. | Massive-scale parallel operations, large-scale data generation and analysis. |

-----

### SequentialWorkflow

A `SequentialWorkflow` executes tasks in a strict order, forming a pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one.

**Description:** Ideal for processes that have clear, ordered steps. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled correctly.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Initialize agents for a 3-step process
# 1. Generate an idea
idea_generator = Agent(agent_name="IdeaGenerator", system_prompt="Generate a unique startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 2. Validate the idea
validator = Agent(agent_name="Validator", system_prompt="Take this startup idea and analyze its market viability.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 3. Create a pitch
pitch_creator = Agent(agent_name="PitchCreator", system_prompt="Write a 3-sentence elevator pitch for this validated startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[idea_generator, validator, pitch_creator])

# Run the workflow
elevator_pitch = workflow.run()
print(elevator_pitch)
```

### ConcurrentWorkflow (with `SpreadSheetSwarm`)

A concurrent workflow runs multiple agents simultaneously. `SpreadSheetSwarm` is a powerful implementation that can manage thousands of concurrent agents and log their outputs to a CSV file.

**Description:** Use this for high-throughput tasks that can be performed in parallel, drastically reducing execution time.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SpreadSheetSwarm

# Define a list of tasks (e.g., social media posts to generate)
platforms = ["Twitter", "LinkedIn", "Instagram"]

# Create an agent for each task
agents = [
    Agent(
        agent_name=f"{platform}-Marketer",
        system_prompt=f"Generate a real estate marketing post for {platform}.",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
    for platform in platforms
]

# Initialize the swarm to run these agents concurrently
swarm = SpreadSheetSwarm(
    agents=agents,
    autosave_on=True,
    save_file_path="marketing_posts.csv",
)

# Run the swarm with a single, shared task description
property_description = "A beautiful 3-bedroom house in sunny California."
swarm.run(task=f"Generate a post about: {property_description}")
# Check marketing_posts.csv for the results!
```

### AgentRearrange

Inspired by `einsum`, `AgentRearrange` lets you define complex, non-linear relationships between agents using a simple string-based syntax.

**Description:** Perfect for orchestrating dynamic workflows where agents might work in parallel, sequence, or a combination of both.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the system
# The researcher will generate content, and then both the writer and editor
# will process that content in parallel.
outputs = rearrange_system.run("Analyze the impact of AI on modern cinema.")
print(outputs)
```

### GraphWorkflow

`GraphWorkflow` orchestrates tasks using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), allowing you to manage complex dependencies where some tasks must wait for others to complete.

**Description:** Essential for building sophisticated pipelines, like in software development or complex project management, where task order and dependencies are critical.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GraphWorkflow, Node, Edge, NodeType

# Define agents and a simple python function as nodes
code_generator = Agent(agent_name="CodeGenerator", system_prompt="Write Python code for the given task.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
code_tester = Agent(agent_name="CodeTester", system_prompt="Test the given Python code and find bugs.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create nodes for the graph
node1 = Node(id="generator", agent=code_generator)
node2 = Node(id="tester", agent=code_tester)

# Create the graph and define the dependency
graph = GraphWorkflow()
graph.add_nodes([node1, node2])
graph.add_edge(Edge(source="generator", target="tester")) # Tester runs after generator

# Set entry and end points
graph.set_entry_points(["generator"])
graph.set_end_points(["tester"])

# Run the graph workflow
results = graph.run("Create a function that calculates the factorial of a number.")
print(results)
```

### MixtureOfAgents (MoA)

The `MixtureOfAgents` architecture processes tasks by feeding them to multiple "expert" agents in parallel. Their diverse outputs are then synthesized by an aggregator agent to produce a final, high-quality result.

**Description:** Use this to achieve state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging the collective intelligence of specialized agents.

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

# Define expert agents
financial_analyst = Agent(agent_name="FinancialAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze financial data.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
market_analyst = Agent(agent_name="MarketAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze market trends.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
risk_analyst = Agent(agent_name="RiskAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze investment risks.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the aggregator agent
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="InvestmentAdvisor",
    system_prompt="Synthesize the financial, market, and risk analyses to provide a final investment recommendation.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the MoA swarm
moa_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator_agent=aggregator,
)

# Run the swarm
recommendation = moa_swarm.run("Should we invest in NVIDIA stock right now?")
print(recommendation)
```

### GroupChat

`GroupChat` creates a conversational environment where multiple agents can interact, discuss, and collaboratively solve a problem. You can define the speaking order or let it be determined dynamically.

**Description:** Ideal for tasks that benefit from debate and multi-perspective reasoning, such as contract negotiation, brainstorming, or complex decision-making.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GroupChat

# Define agents for a debate
tech_optimist = Agent(agent_name="TechOptimist", system_prompt="Argue for the benefits of AI in society.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
tech_critic = Agent(agent_name="TechCritic", system_prompt="Argue against the unchecked advancement of AI.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the group chat
chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[tech_optimist, tech_critic],
    max_loops=4, # Limit the number of turns in the conversation
)

# Run the chat with an initial topic
conversation_history = chat.run(
    "Let's discuss the societal impact of artificial intelligence."
)

# Print the full conversation
for message in conversation_history:
    print(f"[{message['agent_name']}]: {message['content']}")
```
