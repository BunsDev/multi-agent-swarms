## Get Started

### Prerequisites

Before using Gemini Nano Banana models, ensure you have:

1. **Swarms Framework**: Install the latest version of Swarms
   ```bash
   pip install swarms
   ```

2. **API Access**: Configure your Gemini API credentials
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Image Dependencies**: For image processing tasks, ensure you have the necessary image libraries
   ```bash
   pip install pillow requests
   ```

### Model Configuration

The Gemini models are accessed through the `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` model identifier, which provides optimized performance for image-related tasks.

## Image Generation

Create a new Python file (e.g., `img_gen_nano_banana.py`) and use the following code to generate images from text prompts:

```python
from swarms import Agent

IMAGE_GEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are an advanced image generation agent. Given a textual description, generate a high-quality, photorealistic image that matches the prompt. "
    "Return only the generated image."
)

image_gen_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Image-Generation-Agent",
    agent_description="Agent specialized in generating high-quality, photorealistic images from textual prompts.",
    model_name="gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",  # Replace with your preferred image generation model if available
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    max_loops=1,
    dynamic_context_window=True,
    retry_interval=1,
)

image_gen_out = image_gen_agent.run(
    task=f"{IMAGE_GEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT} \n\n Generate a photorealistic image of a futuristic city skyline at sunset.",
)

print("Image Generation Output:")
print(image_gen_out)
```


## Image Editing and Annotation

For image editing and annotation tasks, create a new file (e.g., `jarvis_agent.py`) with the following code:

```python
from swarms import Agent


SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are a location-based AR experience generator. Highlight points of interest in this image and annotate relevant information about it. "
    "Return the image only."
)

# Agent for AR annotation
agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Tactical-Strategist-Agent",
    agent_description="Agent specialized in tactical strategy, scenario analysis, and actionable recommendations for complex situations.",
    model_name="gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview",
    dynamic_temperature_enabled=True,
    max_loops=1,
    dynamic_context_window=True,
    retry_interval=1,
)

out = agent.run(
    task=f"{SYSTEM_PROMPT} \n\n Annotate all the tallest buildings in the image",
    img="hk.jpg",
)
```


## Additional Features


### Custom System Prompts

| Prompt Type | Example | Enterprise Use Case |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
